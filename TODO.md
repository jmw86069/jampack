## TODO for jampack

### Refactoring ideas

* Consider pre-loading all calculated per-transcript values for
speed. Meanwhile create corresponding vignettes to describe how
to calculate each value from raw data. Examples: three prime UTR,
CAI.

### Figures

* update violin plots of CAI and UTR using consistent colors with
supp fig 7 (CAI plot should be green, blue, purple)
* redo supp fig 7b, percentage of transcript type by genelist,
using detected Tx lists


### Stats

* update the diffSplice tables, update number of splicing differences
per comparison (cb-cb, cb-de, de-de)
